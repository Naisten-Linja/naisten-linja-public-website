## About the Technologies

This project is developed with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com).

## Development

First, clone the repository and install dependencies with `npm install`. 

You'll need the values for `.nvmrc` from a developer from this project.

When you have the values, running `npm start` starts the development server. Typical port where Gatsby starts the project is `localhost:8000`, but be sure to check your command line for the correct port.

If you want to explore the GraphQL, you'll find the GraphiQL from `/__graphiql`, so if you have the port running with the default port, then the correct url would be [https://localhost:8000/__graphiql](https://localhost:8000/__graphiql).

## Conventions in This Project

*Work in Progress* 

## Deployment 

Currently the project is deployed from the `production`-branch. To deploy, either merge `master` on your own computer to `production`, and then push, or create a pull request and merge it on Github.

There are plans to make this automatic, but because of the time limits, we haven't gotten to it yet.
